 # What’s new in Swift 5.0

 * Created by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) – [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com)
 * Last update: November 27th 2018

 This playground is designed to showcase new features introduced with Swift 5.0. I already [wrote an article on it](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/126/whats-new-in-swift-5-0), but it's a lot more fun to see things in action and experiment yourself.

 If you hit problems or have questions, you're welcome to tweet me [@twostraws](https://twitter.com/twostraws) or email <paul@hackingwithswift.com>.

 - important: Until a version of Xcode ships with Swift 5.0, you should [download the latest Swift trunk development snapshot](https://swift.org/download/) and activate it inside your current Xcode version.
